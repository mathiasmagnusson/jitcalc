# jitcalc - the JITting calculator

A signed 64-bit integer calculator written in C which produces x86_64
machine code and evaluates it.

It would probably be faster to just parse expressions into a tree and
evaluate it by walking the tree, but I believe like that's been done
enough times already, right?
