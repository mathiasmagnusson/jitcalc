# jitcalc - the JITting calculator

A calculator written in C which produces x86_64 machine code from mathematical
expressions and executes them.

I admit it would probably be faster to just parse expressions into a tree and
evaluate them by walking the tree, but I bet that's been done quite a few times
already.
